# Lorenz Attractor

### A minimal and visual exploration of deterministic chaos

This repository presents a **clear and compact Julia implementation** of the classical **Lorenz system**, one of the foundational models in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory.

The script numerically integrates the original Lorenz equations and produces the iconic three-dimensional *butterfly-shaped* trajectory known as the **Lorenz attractor**.

The focus of this project is **conceptual clarity and visualization**, rather than performance optimization or numerical sophistication.

## The Lorenz attractor (visual result)

Below is the animated trajectory generated by the script:

The orbit alternates irregularly between two symmetric lobes, never intersecting itself, yet remaining bounded for all time — a hallmark of deterministic chaos.

## 1. Scientific and historical context

In the early 1960s, meteorologist **Edward N. Lorenz** was studying simplified models of atmospheric convection at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

While running numerical simulations on a Royal McBee LGP-30 computer, Lorenz discovered that **tiny differences in initial conditions** could lead to dramatically different long-term behavior.
This phenomenon — later popularized as the *butterfly effect* — revealed a fundamental limitation to long-term predictability in deterministic systems.

In 1963, Lorenz distilled this behavior into a minimal system of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations.
Despite their simplicity, these equations generate dynamics that are neither periodic nor random, but chaotic.

## 2. The Lorenz equations

The Lorenz system is defined by

```
dx/dt = σ (y − x)
dy/dt = x (ρ − z) − y
dz/dt = x y − β z
```

with the classical parameter values

```
σ = 10        (Prandtl number)
ρ = 28        (reduced Rayleigh number)
β = 8 / 3     (geometric factor)
```

These equations describe a dissipative dynamical system with nonlinear coupling between variables.

## 3. Dynamical regimes

Depending on the parameter ρ, the system exhibits qualitatively different behavior:

* **0 < ρ < 1**
  The origin is globally stable.

* **ρ = 1**
  A pitchfork bifurcation creates two symmetric nontrivial fixed points.

* **ρ > 24.74**
  These fixed points become unstable, and almost all trajectories are attracted to a **strange attractor**.

The Lorenz attractor is:

* bounded but non-periodic,
* deterministic yet unpredictable,
* fractal, with an estimated dimension of approximately 2.06.

## 4. Fundamental properties of the flow

Several key features of chaotic systems are evident:

* **Volume contraction**
  The divergence of the vector field is constant and negative:

  ```
  ∇·F = −(σ + 1 + β) < 0
  ```

  Phase-space volumes therefore contract exponentially, forcing trajectories onto a lower-dimensional invariant set.

* **Discrete symmetry**

  ```
  (x, y, z) → (−x, −y, z)
  ```

  This symmetry explains the existence of the two mirrored lobes of the attractor.

* **Sensitive dependence on initial conditions**
  Trajectories initially separated by approximately 10⁻⁶ diverge after roughly 15 time units.

---

## 5. Numerical integration approach

The system is integrated using the **forward Euler method** with a fixed time step:

```
Δt = 0.02
```

While this method is not suitable for precise quantitative analysis, this choice is sufficient to:

* preserve the qualitative geometry of the attractor,
* keep the orbit bounded,
* produce visually accurate results over short integration times.

The simulation spans **30 time units**, corresponding to **1,500 integration steps**.

## 6. Julia implementation

The implementation closely follows the official JuliaPlots Lorenz attractor example, with small additions for completeness and reproducibility.

### Origin of the code

The core structure is adapted from the JuliaPlots user gallery:

> [https://docs.juliaplots.org/dev/user_gallery/misc/gr_lorenz_attractor/](https://docs.juliaplots.org/dev/user_gallery/misc/gr_lorenz_attractor/)

### Modifications introduced here

* Explicit package installation (`Pkg.add("Plots")`)
* Fully self-contained script
* Minor stylistic and formatting adjustments
* Generation of an animated GIF for direct embedding in GitHub

### Core animation loop

```julia
anim = @animate for i in 1:1_500
    step!(attractor)
    push!(plt, attractor.x, attractor.y, attractor.z)
end every 10

gif(anim)
```

Every tenth frame is retained, producing a smooth animation with **150 frames**.

## 7. Notes and possible extensions

This script is intentionally minimal, but it can serve as a starting point for deeper exploration:

* Reduce ρ to observe transient chaos collapsing onto fixed points
* Increase the time step to study numerical instability
* Replace Euler integration with `DifferentialEquations.jl`
* Compute Lyapunov exponents or color the trajectory by the `z` coordinate
